            <p>
                Italy’s history rolls back millennia. As soon as you step on Italian soil,
                you will spot its ancient history and culture everywhere.
                Historic Italian cities such as Rome will show you gigantic traces of a mighty ancient empire,
                the Papal kingdom, and Renaissance noble families,
                while smaller cities like Florence will take you through the Middle Ages.
                You’ll also find Middle Age imprints in the towns of Viterbo, Bracciano, Perugia, or Venice.
                Sardinia, on the other hand, is home to the Nuraghe stone towers from the Bronze Age,
                and villages belonging to the Mediterranean island’s ancient civilization.

                    Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning.
                    Romulus and Remus – twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war god –
                    reportedly
                    founded the Eternal City.
                    And although historians are a little skeptical about this epic entry into the world,
                    most travelers are absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome.
                    Whether it's the mystery of nearby Vatican City or the ghosts of the Colosseum,
                    an afternoon caffè on Piazza Navona or a piled-high plate of pasta at a trattoria, Rome is sure to
                    enchant.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Italy'captal city, Rome is also known for a history that dates back to the eras of Octavian,
                    Julius Caesar and Hadrian, among others. Left behind are structures like the Pantheon,
                    the Roman Forum and dozens of churches, among other historic gems.
                    Art enthusiasts will relish the trove of art housed at the Vatican Museums,
                    and foodies will enjoy the splendid Italian fare, not to mention the gelato.
                    And though its momentous past is the focus for many vacationers, Rome is also a fast-paced,
                    modern and relevant city, with gleaming designer storefronts, sleek hotels and cutting-edge
                    restaurants.
